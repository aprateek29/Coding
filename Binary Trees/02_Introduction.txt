A tree is non-linear data structure.


Structure
class Node {
    public:
        int data;
        Node* left;
        Node* right;
};

new keyword is used to create a new Node. Hence a new node is created inside
memory heap and not stack.
Therefor when we create a new node inside a solve() function it remains there.
if we don't use new keyword then memory will be deallocated after function call.


Important Terms
Node - each point in a tree 
Edge - connection between two nodes
Ancestor - any node between root and current node including current Node 
Leaves - Last level nodes 

Level starts from 0
Height - Total number of levels

Types
Skew Tree - At max one child
Full Binary Tree - All levels are completely filled
Complete binary Tree - All levels are filled except last level. From Left to right insertion
Strict binary tree - 0 or 2 child. No 1 child.
