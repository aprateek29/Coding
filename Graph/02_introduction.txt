SC for DFS and BFS = O(V+E)

Graph - Set of vertices and edges

Edges - Connection between two vertices
    Two types - Directed and Undirected

Types of graph - 
    Undirected Graph - Graph with undirected edges
    Directed Graph - Graph with directed edges 


    Weighted Graph - Graph having edges with weights
    Unweighted Graph - Graph having edges with no weights

    Complete Graph - Each vertex is connected to every other vertex

Indegree - No. of edges coming to a vertex
Outdegree - No. of edges going out of a vertex 

Bridge - It is an edge that connects graph. After removing that edge graph 
         will be divided into more than one component

Articulation Point - It is a vertex that connects graph. After removing this vertex 
        graph will be divided into more than one component.

Minimum Spanning Tree - It has V vertex and V-1 edges. We can go from one node to another
        It is undirected mostly
