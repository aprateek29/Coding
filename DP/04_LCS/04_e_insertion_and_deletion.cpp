// number of deletion = a-length - lcs
// number of insertion = b-length - lcs

// Minimum number of deletions and insertions to transform 
// one string into another
// Given two strings ‘str1’ and ‘str2’ of size m and n respectively. 
// The task is to remove/delete and insert minimum number of 
// characters from/in str1 so as to transform it into str2. 
// It could be possible that the same character needs to be 
// removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to 
// some another point.
// Example:
// Input : str1 = "geeksforgeeks", str2 = "geeks"
// Output : Minimum Deletion = 8
//          Minimum Insertion = 0
