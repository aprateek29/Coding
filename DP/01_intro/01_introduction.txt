Dynamic programming is based on recursion
will ask to find something Optimal = max profit, min cost
can be solve by recursion for small inputs

Identification
1. Choices
2. Over lapping sub-problems (more than 1 recursive call)

Steps to solve
1. First write recursive solution
2. Then memoize
3. if req then do bottom up
