Defn  - It is an approach in which we try to find the solution
    by try all the available options

Identification - 

    - High complexity - since we using all options

    - constraints in question are very low
        N < 10
        N < 20
        1 < N < 100
    
    - No guarantee of next step will give the solution

Mainly 4 types
 - Decision Making
    N - Queen Problem

 - Optimization
    Source to Destination path 

 - Permutation 
    ABC - find all Permutation

 - Subset
    123 - find all subset


Flow of backtracking
    think like a inorder traversal of tree
    since you passing data by reference
    remove the current wrong solution from the answer set while backtracking
